# Customer-Segmentation
In this project, we analyze data to understand customer behavior in two scenarios: Codeflix's subscription churn rates and CoolTShirts' marketing click-through rates. For Codeflix, we calculate churn rates for two user segments over three months. For CoolTShirts, we analyze marketing campaigns and customer journeys to optimize marketing strategies.
